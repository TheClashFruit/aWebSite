## What is Sketctwar Copy?
Sketctwar Copy is a community-driven modular android application that can create android apps using block programming like scratch. Every component for Sketctwar Copy is modular, these modules can be loaded and unloaded at runtime, giving users freedom on what they want to do with this app. Create customizable blocks, Custom widgets, Custom manager, Custom project type, Custom everything, Anything you want with it!

#### For Sketchware users...
Sketctwar Copy is basically an app that you can mod easily! It's open source, change what you want, contribute what you want, use what you want! It's also modular, meaning you can create modules to do something else, For example, I want to add a TextInputLayout to my Layout editor, just download an already-existing module that adds TextInputLayout to the layout editor, and boom! That's it, No need to mod sketchware. And if you want to create a module, we have already made an interface for that, check out [sketctwar-copy-module-interface](https://github.com/sketctwar-copy/sketctwar-copy-module-interface), the guide is also there, check out it's [wiki page](https://github.com/sketctwar-copy/sketctwar-copy-module-communicator/wiki/Initial-Idea).

Happy Coding!
